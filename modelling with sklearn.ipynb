    "Bow modelling approach and using spacy embeddings do not provide much information for the model to predict categories. Thus models are lack of generalization considering train accuracies and also difference between train and test accuracies. However, using multilingual embedding with One4All modelling is much better option for each language. However, train accuracies are 100% percent which indicates overfitting as well. Reducing dimensions from 1024 to 300-500 maybe overcome overfitting or for some algorithms such as xgboost we can use early stoppings."
